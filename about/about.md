Adventurer's Codex
==================

Adventurers require a lot of things: food, water, weapons, amulets, scrolls of
protection from Gnomes, etc and it can be hard for the modern adventurer to keep 
track of all of it. That's where we can help!

We keep track of all of the pesky details that come with being an adventurer,
and we make it easy for you to find and manage it all. It's time to get back to
what really matters, the adventure!


Open Source Libraries
---------------------

No adventurer can do it alone, and neither could we. Let it here be noted those
who's brave work and nobel sacrifice let this codex come to be. We salute all
those who coded deep into the night, who forged rivers of logic where only
fields of chaos existed before, who saw the world and thought there had to be a
better way, and who looked at us and said, "Take this, it's dangerous to go
alone."

We salute you.
